## About
_**G**it**H**ub **Re**pos**P**osted on **T**witter_ (i.e. **GHRePT**) is a
simple _Twitter bot_. It _greps tweets_ for the mention of **GitHub**. Why?
Because I wanted a way to _filter my Twitter_ for all the **GitHub** repos
being posted, and what better inspiration for such a tool than [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep).
